# Bert Inference for Question-Answering (PyTorch)
```inference.py``` contains the code for BERT inference for the question-answering task. The following command runs a pre-trained BERT model on one question-text pair: 

```python inference.py --question [question] --text [text]```

The substring of the text that the model predicts as the answer will be printed to console.
